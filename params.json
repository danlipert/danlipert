{"body":"### Welcome to my web site\r\n\r\nMy name is Dan Lipert and I'm a iOS, web, and Django developer living in beautiful Portland, OR. I own [The Ministry of Apps](http://tmoa.us), where we work with clients to help them conceptualize, develop, and market their startups and apps.\r\n\r\n### My projects\r\n\r\nI'm hoping to add more and more of my work here, but for now you can check out my iPad template for a [split view with two navigation controllers](https://github.com/danlipert/Double-Navigation-Split-View).  It's a great starting point for any iPad app with lots of drill downs and different types of detail views.\r\n\r\n### My favorite libraries\r\n\r\nI love github and my company could not succeed without the amazing contributions by talented developers worldwide.\r\n\r\n* [Django](https://github.com/django/django) - An amazing web framework that we use to create our APIs\r\n* [ASIHTTPRequest](https://github.com/django/django) - Networking on iOS made easy\r\n* [Bootstrap](https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap/) - Even I can create a pleasant interface :)","name":"Dan Lipert","tagline":"Owner of The Ministry of Apps, mobile and server side development","google":"UA-33897723-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
